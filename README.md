K3NG Arduino CW Keyer

The K3NG Keyer is an open source Arduino based CW (Morse Code) keyer with a lot of features and flexibility, rivaling commercial keyers which often cost significantly more. The code can be used with a full blown Arduino board or an AVR microcontroller chip can be programmed and used directly in a circuit. This keyer is suitable as a standalone keyer or for use permanently installed inside a rig, especially homebrew QRP rigs. It’s open source code so you can fully customize it to fit your needs and also perhaps learn from it or find coding ideas for other projects.

 PS2 Keyboard Notes (FEATURE_PS2_KEYBOARD)

    To use FEATURE_PS2_KEYBOARD you need the K3NG_PS2Keyboard.h and K3NG_PS2Keyboard.cpp library files from https://github.com/k3ng/k3ng_cw_keyer/tree/master/libraries

    Some keyboards may require a reset sequence upon startup.  This is activated with OPTION_PS2_KEYBOARD_RESET.

 USB Keyboard Notes (FEATURE_USB_KEYBOARD)

    To use a USB keyboard you need to download and install this library: https://github.com/felis/USB_Host_Shield_2.0 .  You may use an Arduino Mega
    ADK board (which has a built in USB host interface, get or Circuits@Home USB shield (http://www.circuitsathome.com/products-page/arduino-shields/usb-host-shield-2-0-for-arduino),
    or built your own MAX3421 based USB port.

    If you are using an Arduino Mega ADK with Arduino IDE older than version 1.5.5, you must customize the USB Host Shield Library settings.h file!

    If you are using Arduino IDE older than version 1.5.5 and you experience a compiler error, you may need to add these lines to your keyer.h file:

        #define HID_PROTOCOL_KEYBOARD 1
        #define HID_PROTOCOL_MOUSE 2

    (Thanks Raimo, DL1HTB, for the two notes above.)

    Option Usb Computer Keyboard Emulation FEATURE_CW_COMPUTER_KEYBOARD
    (Arduino Due, Leonardo only)

       You can use your cw key as a computer keyboard. Your computer recognize the K3NG keyer as a normal keyboard.
       Language available English and Italian (more languages to add)
       Use following prosign to emulate Enter Key, Caps Lock, space and backspace:
       Prosign AA "Enter"
       Prosign DO "Caps Lock" (enable and disable)
       "......" or more "Backspace"
       "------" or more "Space"

  SIDETONE_SWITCH
       Enabling this feature and an external toggle switch  adds switch control for playing cw sidetone.
       ST Switch status is displayed in the status command.  This feature will override the software control of the sidetone (\o).


Useful Stuff
    Reset to defaults: squeeze both paddles at power up (good to use if you dorked up the speed and don't have the CLI)
    Press the right paddle to enter straight key mode at power up
    Press the left  paddle at power up to enter and stay forever in beacon mode
